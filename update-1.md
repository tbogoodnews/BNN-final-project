We have completed the majority of the code to write our BNN network, including visualizations, and have done the majority of the process of selecting for the hyperparamaters for our model. In addtion, we have done a substansional amount of work on the presentation as well as the report.

We can't attach our presentation, paper, or `.ipynb` to this submission, so we can only point you to our repo at [https://github.com/tbogoodnews/BNN-final-project](https://github.com/tbogoodnews/BNN-final-project).
